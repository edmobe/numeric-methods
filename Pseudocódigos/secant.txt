Newton(f, x_0, x_1, tol, maxIter) -> [xn, err, iter, fx]
	% Secant Method
	% Inputs:
	%   - f is a polinomial expression introduced as a symbolic expression
	%   - x_0 is an initial value
	%	- x_1 is an initial value
	%   - tol is the tolerance
	% 	- maxIter is the maximum amount of iterations
	% Outputs:
	%   - xn is the solution
	%   - err is the error
	%   - iter is the amount of completed iterations
	%   - fx is f(x)
	Handle the function
	Initialize x_{n-1} as x_0
	Initialize x_n as x_1
	Starting at iter = 1 and ending at maxIter:
		Evaluate the divisor: div
		If div == 0:
			Alert division by zero
			End function
		Evaluate the function f(x)
		Calculate x_{n+1} using the Newton-Raphson's definition
		Calculate the error
		If the tolerance is satisfied:
			End function
		x_{n-1} = x_n
		x_n = x_{n+1}
