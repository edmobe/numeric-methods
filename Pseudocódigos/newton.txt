Newton(f, x_0, tol, maxIter) -> [xn, err, iter, fx]
	% Newton-Raphson Method
	% Inputs:
	%   - f is a polinomial expression introduced as a symbolic expression
	%   - x_0 is the initial value
	%   - tol is the tolerance
	% 	- maxIter is the maximum amount of iterations
	% Outputs:
	%   - xn is the solution
	%   - err is the error
	%   - iter is the amount of completed iterations
	%   - fx is f(x)
	Calculate the expression of the derivative of the function
	Handle the function
	Handle the derivative
	Initialize xNext as x0
	Starting at iter = 0 and ending at maxIter:
		x_n now is what was previously defined as xNext
		Evaluate the derivative in x_n: f'(x_n)
		If f'(x_n) == 0:
			Alert division by zero
			End function
		Evaluate the function f(x)
		Calculate x_{n+1} using the Newton-Raphson's definition
		Calculate the error
		If the tolerance is satisfied:
			End function
