Bisection(f, a, b, tol) -> [xn, err, iter, fx]
	% Bisection Method
	% Inputs:
	%   - f is a polinomial expression introduced as a symbolic expression
	%   - a and b are [a, b]
	%   - tol is the tolerance
	% Outputs:
	%   - xn is the solution
	%   - err is the error
	%   - iter is the amount of completed iterations
	%   - fx is f(x)
	Handle the function
	Evaluate f(a)
	Evaluate f(b)
	If f(a) * f(b) is positive:
		End function
	Calculate the maximum amount of iterations: maxIter
	Starting at iter = 0 and ending at maxIter:
		Calculate the middle point
		Evaluate the function at the middle point: f(x_n)
		Calculate the error
		If f(x_n) == 0:
			Exact root found!
			a = xn
			b = xn
		If f(x_n) * f(b) > 0:
			b = x_n
      		f(b) = f(x)
    	else
      		a = x_n
      		f(a) = f(x)
		If the tolerance is satisfied:
			End function
